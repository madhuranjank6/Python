It provides a way to perform a single action in different forms. Polymorphism is typically achieved through method overriding and interfaces\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "Polymorphism is a Powerful feature of OOP that allows for flexibility and integration in code design. It enables a single function to handle objects of different classes, each with its own implementation of a method. By understanding and applying the polymorphism, we can create more extensible and maintainable Object-Oriented programs"
